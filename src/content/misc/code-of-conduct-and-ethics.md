# Welcome to the 4Geeks Academy Code of Conduct and Ethics. 

This is how we work.

Being a member of the 4geeks Academy team comes with a lot of good things and responsibility. Our culture of our work environment is made of how each and every one of us act, speak and behave, every day.

This is our Code of Conduct and Ethics, it is based on our policies and our
Values: CODING. PASSION. LEARNING. INNOVATION. Above all, it describes
our top rules and how to make sure we follow them:

1. Do the right thing. Always act with honesty and integrity. Maintain high moral and ethical standards. You are the Culture: role model the Behavior you Want to see.
2. Be kind. Treat people with respect, regardless of who they are and Where do they come from? Be decent and courteous in all relationships. 
3. Play fair. Try to balance the interests of the entire community (stakeholders, teachers, students, users, employees, freelancers and the general public). We are all 4geeks!
4. Assume your responsibilities and the consequences of your actions, we are here to learn and grow.
5. Communicate constantly, and what you don't know: ask.

Failing to follow the Code may lead to disciplinary action, or even termination of
employment.

Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations

It’s very simple: We respect and obey the law, in letter and in spirit. Always.
This goes for all laws of the cities, states and countries where we operate. Make sure
you know enough about the laws that apply to ask for further information and help from
supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel when you need it.
If you find that the law conflicts with this Code or any of our policies, always go with the
law and discuss the perceived conflict with your supervisor, manager or other
appropriate personnel.



Full, Fair, Accurate, Timely and Understandable Disclosure

The information in 4Geeks Academy’s public communications must be full, fair, accurate, timely
and understandable. This includes all reports and documents that we file with or submit
to regulatory bodies. You should be familiar with 4geeks Academy’s disclosure obligations related
to your position. You cannot knowingly misrepresent or omit (or cause others to do the
same) material facts about Spotify to others, especially auditors, government regulators
and self-regulatory organizations.

Conflicts of Interest

At times you may face conflicting loyalties between personal or professional benefits for you, your friends or family, and 4Geeks Academy. You must avoid situations that create a real or perceived conflict of interest between you and 4Geeks Academy at all times. Any situation that involves, or might later involve a conflict of interest, should be disclosed promptly to 4Geeks Academy. Some practical examples of conflicts of interest can be found in our Contracts. To the extent that you find yourself with a question, please feel free to reach out culture@4geeksacademy.com and our legal team is happy to help. 

In case you have doubts about presenting a conflict of interest, we will always be willing to discuss any situation you want.

Corporate Opportunities

You owe a duty to 4Geeks Academy to advance its business interests whenever possible. You
cannot take any opportunity for yourself that arises through 4Geeks Academy’s business
relationships or that is discovered through the use of 4Geeks Academy’s property or information. You cannot use our property and resources for your personal gain and you cannot compete
against 4Geeks Academy. 

Confidentiality

The use of confidential business information is critical to 4geeks Academy’s success. When you
receive access to confidential information at 4geeks Academy, it’s up to you to keep it safe and
make sure it stays confidential. This includes all information that is not public and that
can be of use to competitors or harmful to 4geeks Academy if it’s disclosed. It also includes
information that others, like users, artists, vendors or partners, have trusted us with.
This rule applies even after your employment here ends. Confidentiality provisions are
part of each employee’s employment contracts and professional services contracts, so please do refer back to your documents.

Fair competition

always be good. Don’t lie or steal or cheat. Don’t use information that was obtained
without the owner’s consent or secret information that is wrongfully disclosed by past or
present employees of other companies. Deal fairly with our customers, suppliers,
competitors and employees, and always respect their rights. Don’t take unfair 
advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
information, misrepresentation of facts or any other kind of intentional dirty tricks or
unfair practice. 


Discrimination and Harassment

The diversity of 4geeks Academy’s employees is a tremendous asset. We come from all around
the world and represent a variety of cultures and represent a variety of cultures,
experiences and diverse backgrounds. We strive to create and maintain an inclusive
work environment in which all of our employees are treated with dignity, decency and
respect. Everyone has the right to feel included and valued here, and allowed to bring
their very best to the mix.
The vibe of our work environment is made up of how each and every one of us acts and
speaks every day. So we are all responsible for it. In short, we make each other feel
welcome and included. We don’t accept any sort of harassment, intimidation or
rudeness and this includes comments, jokes and questions that are insensitive/inappropriate.


Reporting any Illegal or Unethical Behavior

If you believe that anyone at 4geeks Academy has engaged in conduct that violates a law,
regulation, or this Code, we want to know as quickly as possible! Report your concern to
xx@4geeks.co. You should also feel free to raise any issue with your managers.

Non-Retaliation

Please always feel safe and free to speak up about misconduct. We all rely on every
employee taking that responsibility and the goal is always to resolve problems as
quickly as possible so that we all can continue doing great work!
If you report something you suspect violates this Code, our policies, or the law, it is
utterly forbidden at 4geeks Academy to retaliate against you in any way. All we ask is that you only raise concerns in good faith. “In good faith” doesn’t mean you have to be right or even
sure that a violation has occurred, it just means that you believe whatever you report is
Truthful.

Safety and Healthy

Violence, threatening behavior, or use of illegal drugs is never allowed in our house.
Neither is reporting to work under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. 

Record-Keeping 

Always keep our records and reporting honest and accurate. All of our books, records, accounts, and financial statements have to tell the truth about our transactions, be reasonably detailed, and follow both legal requirements and our own internal controls system. No entry may be made that intentionally hides or disguises the true nature of any transaction. We never use exaggerations, derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people or companies in our business records or communication. And remember that all business records and communications can become public at some point, so keep them all fit for bright light. When you travel or have business expenses, do document and record them. If there is a litigation or a governmental investigation, please consult the Legal team regarding what should be retained and what may be destroyed. 


Protection and Proper Use of 4Geeks Academy Assets

It’s part of all our job descriptions to protect 4geeks Academy assets and ensure they are used
efficiently. Be mindful of waste and carelessness and if you suspect fraud or theft, report
it immediately! 4Geeks Academy owns the equipment you are given, email accounts, software, other IT devices and materials. They are for your use but they are all company property, please treat them as such.

Failing to follow the Code may lead to disciplinary action, or even termination of
employment.
