# We love questions! We are here to answer them!

First of all, please ask questions!!!!!! I cannot say this more often, its the best way we have to help students. Its a great source of information to understand students weaknesses, level of understanding and learning pace. Questions are also the most powerful way to stop being frustrated.

# It takes a bit of time to ask the right question

When working remote, you have to pay lots of attention to the way you communicate your ideas, questions, etc.

Belive me when I tell you that follwing these steps you will get straigh answers in a matter of minutes instead of having to iterate back and forth. Here is a guide on [how to ask questions by stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

## 1. Prepare your question

Lets compare these two questions:
```md
1. Who can i add one item to an array?
2. I'm trying to add an item to an array in javascript, this is my code but its not working (screenshoot), what am I doing wrong?
```

## 2. Take a picture or screenshot

Everyone has a different device, if you pest a text code it will look all different on the phone and it may not have any color highlighting, if you pase a picture it will keep formating whoever is reading will be able to zoom in.

## 3. Be specific

Don't ask "how can I solve this exercise", its better to ask something specific like: "How can I start building this exercise" or "I tried this approach but it did not work, what am I doing wrong?"

## 4. Do your research

Take around 20 minutes to try and solve the problem yourself, read online and have a strategy. This is the real ultimate goal, to come up with strategies instead of finding the solution.

## 5. Use the slack channel instead of email, or anything else

Slack is the perfect tool for this, you can event start an instance video call with the responder, avoid using traditional less effective methods like phone or sms.
