# JavaScript Array Some Method

As one of the daily basic parts of programming languages array some method in javascript is typically used for data testing. Take a look at the following example showing one way to use the Array `some()` method of Javascript: 

```js
const customArray = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,];
const isEven = (element) => element % 8 === 0;
console.log(array.some(isEven));
```

This code shown uses the Array Some Method on the `customArray` array to perform an even numbers checking condition and the `console.log()` to print the result. In this example, if at least one element in the array is an even number the function will print `true` in the console, otherwise, it will print `false`.

## The Array Some Method in Javascript

Nowadays known as one of the most familiar [Arrays](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-an-array-define-array) methods to test in [Javascript](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript) we have the Array Some method. What `some()` method performs is testing whether at least one element of the array matches the test executed by our custom `function`. The Array Some Method will always return `true` if, it finds an element that matches the logic of the provided `function`; otherwise, it will should always return `false`.

## Examples

Here are some short demonstrations using the Array Some Method:

#### Some Array Javascript - Checking Existing Value Example

```js
const myColorArray = ["red", "white", "green", "orange", "purple"];
 
function checkColor(arr, val) {
  return arr.some((arrVal) => val === arrVal);
}

checkColor(myColorArray, "black"); // false
checkColor(myColorArray, "green"); // true
```

In this given code snippet, We are checking if any of the elements in the array are equal to the value. Array `some()` is performing a callback function that will return `true` if there is a color in the `myColorArray` array that matches the value of the argument, and `false` if there is not such element in the array.


#### Some Array Javascript - Checking Value of Arrays Example

```js
function isBiggerThan30(element, index, array) {
  return element > 30;
}

[10, 15, 18, 11, 14].some(isBiggerThan30); // false
[12, 50, 18, 22, 33].some(isBiggerThan30); // true
```

In the previous example we are checking if the value of the element argument is greater than 30 (`element > 30`) using the `some()` method on two similar arrays of `numbers`. If our condition is matched, the function will return a value of `true`, if not it will return `false`

Array Some Method or Array `some()` shown in the examples before, is just a way used in [Javascript](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript) for programmers like you and me to perform condition checking. We can use it or call the array some method every single time that we require to perform a check on any element in an [array](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-an-array-define-array). 

## Syntax

Syntaxis for using the Array Some method is as follows:

```js
Array.some(callbackFn)
Array.some(callbackFn, thisArg)
```

### Parameters

The following parameters are the ones you should consider while using the Array Some method in your Javascript applications:

- callbackFn: Function to execute for each element in the array.
- Element: Current element being processed.
- Index: Index, or identification of the current element.
- thisArg: Value to use as this when executing the callbackFn.

By understanding the parameters and syntax of the Array Some method, it will be pretty easy for you to implement data testing in your applications, and it will help you to write better and clearer code. 


## Conclusion

[Javascript](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript) provides a powerful and useful method called Array Some that can be pretty useful to check if the elements of an array match some specific conditions. Array Some have pretty similar behavior to the Array Filter method, but, all we need to have into consideration while using the Array Some() is that the Array Some Method will always return `true` if at least one element in the array passes our condition or test. The Array Some Method is indeed an essential tool that lets/helps developers to write cleaner code and save a lot of debugging time.
