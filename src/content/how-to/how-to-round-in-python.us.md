# How to Round Numbers in Python

To round numbers in Python is a very used operation since it is used in almost every field in programming to archive multiple goals. It offers many  ways to achieve this. During this article, we will see several methods in python to round numbers such as round up, round down,  round to a specific decimal number and round to the nearest whole number.

As a quick example,  here is a code snippet of rounding a number in Python:

```python

number = 3.78
rounded_number = round(number)

print(rounded_number)

# Output:
# 4

```

In the previous example we rounded to the nearest whole number the variable ‘number’ which was 3.78. The result in the stored in ‘rounded_number’ is printed in the console as ‘4’

## What does rounding a number in Python mean?

This process implies to get a specific number to specific precision or to the nearest number. In this, we can simplify and manage easily a number in different scenarios, especially if we are working with a large dataset.

## Different ways to round a number in Python

Now let’s see some techniques to perform this task:

**Round to the nearest whole number**: To round a number to the nearest whole number, we can use the method "round()" in  Python. 
This function  only takes one argument which is the number in question and returns a rounded number:

```python

number = 3.78
rounded_number = round(number)

print(rounded_number)

# Output:
# 4

```
In this example, the “round()” function rounds the variable number to the nearest whole number that is 4.

**Round up**: To round a number up to the next whole number,  it is possible to use the math function ‘math.ceil()’ from the math module built-in in Python. Using this, the method will return the smallest number greater than or equal to the target number.

```python
import math

number = 3.78
number_to_be_roundend = math.ceil(number)

print(number_to_be_roundend)
#Output
# 4
```
In the code snippet above, we import the module “math” to get the function “ceil()” which will help rounding the number 3.78 to 4 as the next whole number.

**Round down**: In this case, we can use “math.floor()” from the math module.

```python
 import math

number = 3.78
number_to_be_roundend = math.floor(number)

print(number_to_be_roundend)
#Output
# 3

```
In this code, we again import the “math” module to use the function “floor()” and round the number 3.78 to the previous whole number that is 3

**Rounding to a specific decimal place**: If we want to round a number to a specific dicumal place, we can use second parameter in “round()” called “ndigits”. This parameter indicated how many decimals we want our number to be dounded:

```python

number = 3.1415
number_to_be_roundend = round (number, 2)

print(number_to_be_roundend)
#Output
# 3.15

```
By using the second parameter, we can specify the number of decimals we want our number to round to.

**Round to the nearest tenth**: To achieve this, we can use math operations with the“round()” method like in the  following code snippet:

```python

number = 3.78
number_to_be_roundend = round (number, * 10) / 10

print(number_to_be_roundend)
#Output
# 3.8
```

In the previous example, we multiple the number 3.78 by 10, then we round it to the nearest whole number which is 38, and finally we divide it by 10 again. The outcome is 3.8.

## Use cases

Here some common examples where the “round()“ methods is used:

1.	Financial calculations: When dealing with finances, it is crucial to be concise and accurate with number and amount. 
2.	Data Analysis: When it comes to analyze large datasets, to round numbers might come handy to simplify calculations and highlight trends or patterns.
3.	Statistics: Rounding numbers will definitely help during this type of analysis where sometimes numbers with decimals can show incorrect data or false positives.
4.	User interface: To show rounded numbers in front of users can improve their experience and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Conclusion 

Finally, rounding numbers in Python is a fundamental operation that provides more options and opportunities when dealing with numbers in programming. Through this article, we analyzed what rounding numbers in Python is, most common methods like rounding up or down, and mentioned some use cases where is pretty common to use round. Using and exercising these skills will improve our code when using the round method in Python.
