Arrays are an essential and useful data structure of any programming language, they allow you to store and manipulate large amount of data easily. JavaScript has several methods that make working with arrays straightforward, you can learn more about [arrays in JavaScript](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-an-array-define-array) at 4Geeks. One of the most useful methods is the **slice** method.

## Array.slice()

```jsx
const animals = ["dog", "cat", "fish", "fox", "bird"];
console.log(animals.slice(0,2));
// Output: ["dog', "cat"]
```

In the previous snippet of code, we use `**Array.slice()**` to create a subarray from the array assigned to `animals`. In this article we will be exploring how to use the slice method, different solutions, the syntax, parameters that can be used and returned values.

## What Does JavaScript Array Slice Method Do?

The **`.slice()`** method  creates a shallow copy of some or all of the elements from the original array starting at a specific index and ending at another index. The original array remains unmodified. The `slice` method received two arguments: the `start` index and the `end` index.

The `slice` method returns a new array that includes all elements from the start index up to but not including the end index. If the end index is not passed to the slice method, it will return an array with the elements from the start to the end of it.

We can use the following syntax for the `slice()` method:

```jsx
slice()
slice(start)
slice(start, end)
```

Parameters:

- `start` (Optional) - The index where the extraction of the elements begins. If `start` is omited, is `0` by default. Negative values count back from the end of the array.
- `end` (Optional) - The index where the extraction of the elements ends. The element at this index is not included.

## How to Use JavaScript Array Slice?

Using the `slice` method in [JavaScript](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript) is simple. Letâ€™s explore different use cases:

```jsx
const courses = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C#", "Ruby"];
const myCourses = courses.slice(1, 3);
console.log(myCourses);
```

Output: `["Python", "Java"]`

In this example we created an array of strings and assigned it to `courses` variable. Then we used the `slice` method with two numbers as arguments to return a new array that contains the elements from the original array starting at index 1 and ending at index 3 (but not including it). The `myCourses` returned array from the slice method contains the elements 1 and 2. It is important to note that arrays are **zero indexed**, ****which means the first element of an array is at index `0`.

If we want to extract all the elements starting from a specific index to the full length of the array, we can omit the second argument as follows:

```jsx
const courses = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C#", "Ruby"];
const myCourses = courses.slice(3);
console.log(myCourses);
```

Output: `["C#", "Ruby"]`

In the previous example we only used one parameter in the slice method to create a new array and return an array with all the elements starting at index 3 until the end of the array as we passed the number 3 as an argument.

If we `console.log()` the original array courses, we can note that the original array remains unchanged.

```jsx
console.log(courses);
```

Output: `["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C#", "Ruby"]`

The slice method also supports negative numbers as parameters to counts back from the end:

```jsx
const courses = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C#", "Ruby"];
const myCourses = courses.slice(-2);
console.log(myCourses);
```

Output: `["C#", "Ruby"]`

In this solution the slice method returned an array with the last two elements from the original array.

Also, we can use two negative parameters to extract a portion of the array counting from the back:

```jsx
const courses = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C#", "Ruby"];
const myCourses = courses.slice(-3,-1);
console.log(myCourses);
```

Output: `["Java", "C#"]`

In the previous snippet of code the slice method returned a subarray from the original array counting from the back.

## Advantages of the Slice Method in JavaScript

The `slice` method is a great useful tool in JavaScript. It can help us to write clean code and make it more readable and maintainable. Here are some advantages of implementing slice method in our code:

- Non-destructive: The `slice` method creates a new array which contains a part of the original array. Leaving the referenced object untouched.
- Easy to use: The `slice` method only takes two arguments, making this method straightforward to use and extract the desired elements from an array.
- Flexible: The `slice` method allows us to extract any portion of an array. From a start index to an end index or to the end of the array, also supports negative indexing. This feature let us to use the slice method in a wide range of situations and combine the slice method with other array methods.
- Returns a new array: The `slice` method returns a new array, which means we can chain different array methods and make the code more concise, easier to read and maintain.

## Conclusion

The **`.slice()`** method is a powerful method that can be used to create a copy of an array or return a portion of the original array. It is important to know that the returned array is a shallow copy, which means that the slice method does not alter the original array, and can make working with arrays more easier and manageable.
