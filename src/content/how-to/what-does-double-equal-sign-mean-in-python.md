The double equal sign are used to compare two values. In logical operators, it will return `True` if both values are equal, otherwise it will return `False`

```python
x = 5
y= '5'
z = 5

print(x==y) 
#output -> false

print(x==z) 
#output -> true
```

## The equal `=` sign in Python:

The equal sign `=` in Python, as many other programming languages is used to **assign** a value to a variable and the most important important word is **assign**.

```python 
# creating a variable and assigning a value with the = symbol
x = "Geek!"
print(x) #Output-> Geek!
```

## The double equal `==` operator 

Although, when we use in human language "equals to" we are referring to comparison and the answer is always **yes or no** (this shirt color is equal to this short color). Now, since we used already the `=` to **assign** a value, we still need to compare (with logical thinking) if some data stored in a variable is equal to other data and thats where the `==` comes in our rescue.

```python
x = 5
y= '5'
z = 5

print(x==y) 
#output -> false

print(x==z) 
#output -> true
```

If you look closely, youÂ´ll see that despite `x` and `y` having the same value, it stills return `false`... Why is that? The double equal logic operator checks for the value and the type of the data compared one another. In our previous example we used a number (`Int` in this case, but could be a `float` to name just one) and compare it with a `String`. Since the type of data is not the same, Python will return as `false` and only return `true` when both, the **value** and the **type** are the same as when compared `x` with `z`.

Keep in mind, the **double equal** sign in Python, as in many other programming languages is for comparing 2 elemens and the only possible return is **true** or **false** (boolean). 

```python
x= 1
y= '1'
z= 1
#returns false
print(x==y) #output -> false 
print(x=='1') #output -> false
print(x=='p') #output -> false
print(x=='1') #output -> false
#returns true
print(x==z) #output -> true
print(x==1) #output -> true
```

## Implementation

### Using the == operator on loops

Let's say that we have a list of names and we want to find if **one** name is present.

```python
# We will loop through the list with a `for loop` to find if Jane is on the provided list
# The function will receive 2 elements, the list (array) and the name to find on the list
# If the name is on the list, we will return the name and it's position on the list 

names= ["James", "Willy", "Jane", "Barbara", "Pete", "Barbara"]

def findName(arr, nameToSearch):
    for x in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[x] == nameToSearch:
            return (str(arr[x]) + " at position " + str(x))

print(findName(names, "Jane"))
#Output-> Jane at position 2
```

Another example, now we'll be using a **while loop**. This time we'll be helping a rocking band to start a song!

```python
# We will create a function for a band to start rocking
# We will recive the ammount of beats to wait to start rocking
# With a while loop, until we reach the number of beats, we will show the classic "and 1..., and 2..., etc..."
def offBeat(numOfBeats):
  x=1
  while x <=numOfBeats:
    print("and " + str(x)+"... ")
    x+=1
      
offBeat(4)
#Output-> and 1... and 2... and 3... and 4...
```
