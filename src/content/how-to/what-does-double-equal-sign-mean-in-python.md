```python
x = 5
y= '5'
z = 5

print(x==y) 
#output -> false

print(x==z) 
#output -> true
```

## The equal `=` sign in Python:

The equal sign `=` in Python, as many other programming languages is used to **assign** a value to a variable and the most important important word is **assign**.

```python 
#crating a variable and assigning a value with the = symbol
x = "Geek!"
print(x) #Output-> Geek!
```

## The double equal `==` operator 

Although, when we use in human language "equals to" we are referring to comparison and the answer is always **yes or no** (this shirt color is equal to this short color). Now, since we used already the `=` to **asign** a value, we still need to compare (with logical thinking) if some data stored in a variable is equal to other data and thats where the `==` comes in our rescue.

```python
x = 5
y= '5'
z = 5

print(x==y) 
#output -> false

print(x==z) 
#output -> true
```

If you look closely, youÂ´ll see that despite `x` and `y` having the same value, it stills return `false`... Why is that? The double equal logic operator checks for the value and the type of the data compared one another. In our previous example we used a number (`Int` in this case, but could be a `float` to name just one) and compare it with a `String`. Since the type of data is not the same, Python will return as `false` and only return `true` when both, the **value** and the **type** are the same as when compared `x` with `z`.

Keep in mind, the **double equal** sign in Python, as in many other programming languages is for comparing 2 elemens and the only possible return is **true** or **false** (boolean). 

```python
x= 1
y= '1'
z= 1
#returns false
print(x==y) #output -> false 
print(x=='1') #output -> false
print(x=='p') #output -> false
print(x=='1') #output -> false
#returns true
print(x==z) #output -> true
print(x==1) #output -> true
```

Hope you enjoy the reading and keep on the Geek side!
