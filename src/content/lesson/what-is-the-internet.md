## It all makes sense if we go back in time…

If everything is a text document, how is it possible to have websites so amazing like Facebook, Youtube, etc?

Today’s websites are very different than before; they don’t have the same elements, but if we go back a bit in the past and explore the beginning of the Internet, it will all make sense.

The Internet was created for exchanging information.  Its founders were looking for ways to share documents without having to rely on a complex infrastructure.  They needed a framework and technology so that each person who wished to share a document could publish it independently and invite others to read it.

The scientific community started using it for the famous [“Peer Reviews”](https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review), which required 3 colleagues to review and approve publications before they were accepted and published for all of the community to see.

For this reason, they worked on something as similar as possible to a Microsoft Word document or any other word processor.

>The easiest way to look at the Internet is that it is like a network of shared documents that were once rigid, formal scientific publications and, nowadays, are interactive, exciting and spectacular.

## Everything is Text (HTTP)


As it was to be expected, if you wish to share documents, all you need is text.  When you build web pages, everything runs under the HTTP protocol (The Hypertext Transfer Protocol) which is a specialist in text transmission.

What this means is that: everything is text.  For example, if you wish to send a photograph to your grandmother through an email, this is more or less what happens:

The picture becomes text (at this point, its text that you wont be able to understand).
It gets transmitted through the Internet as text.  If a hacker intercepts this, what they would see is a bunch of symbols/letters/numbers one after the other.
That chain of characters arrives at your grandmother’s computer.
Your grandmother double clicks the photo and the program she is using to see the photo transforms that text back into an image understandable to a human.
