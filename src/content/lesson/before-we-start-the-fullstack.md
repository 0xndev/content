To better take advantage of this course we encourage you to finish and review any contents from the Coding Introduction Prework. 
The upcoming materias assume that you have full understanding of the following topics:

- What is HTML and what is it used for?
- The most important tags like headings (`<h1>,<h2>,<h3>`...), paragraphs (`<p>`), ordered/unorderer lists, etc: Think about how each of these tags change the look and feel and behavior in your website text. What looks bigger, h1 or h2? Why use ul instead of ol?, etc.
- How include a separate CSS stylesheet into your website by using the `<link>` tag.
- How to override or enhance the way that HTML tags look and behave by using CSS selectors and rules, for example:
  - How can I select an element to update its styles? [By using a selector](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-css-learn-css#wait-what-is-a-selector).
  - The most simple thing like change text color and manipulating fonts (size, family, etc). 
  - Changing elements background color or image, 
- Fully comprehend the `<div>` tag that inherently behaves as a "box" (wich means that it has borders, with and height) and how to use `<div>` to separate your content visually.
- How to create the most common website layouts using the `display: flex;` CSS rule.
