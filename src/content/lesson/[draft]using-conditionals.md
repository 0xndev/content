## What is a condition?

We make decisions every day since we wake up, most of them are already automated in our brains: Should I make coffe?, Should I ware the red or the blu shirt?, etc. 

A very similar process of thought can be taugh to a computer, specifing what actions should be done depending on particular situations. For example, think about a baby monitor that will have a termomteter following up on the baby's temprature:

`If`... **the temprature is more than 28**... send an sms to +1345 5557777.
`Else`... do nothing.

That is what we call a "condition" that limits the execution of a particular block of code depending on one or more variable values.
