## We already know what variables are

We make decisions every day since we wake up, most of them are already automated in our brains: Should I make coffe?, Should I ware the red or the blu shirt?, etc. 

A very similar process of thought can be taugh to a computer, specifing what actions should be done depending on particular situations. For example, think about a baby monitor that will have a termomteter following up on the baby's temprature:

`If`... **the temprature is more than 28**... send an sms to the doctor.
`Else`... do nothing.

We already know that a variable contains some information like: colors, names, emails, etc.

Now we need the computar to perform different tasks based on those conditions, for example:
