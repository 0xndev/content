# Interview Preparation 

Interviews are a key moment of any selection process. Usually Software Developer jobs are composed of one behavioral interview and one technical interview or proficiency test. The behavioral interview is usually based on core competencies and recruiters are trying to figure out whether you are a good fit for the company and the role. Practicing and preparing for an interview will help you feel more comfortable and set a good impression upon the interviewer. It will also allow you to articulate your story and experience in a way that can showcase both your hard and soft skills.
