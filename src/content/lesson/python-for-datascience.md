> This lesson is a roadmap on how to learn Python for data science. If you already know Python and have -at least some- experience with the data science libraries Pandas, Numpy, etc. You can skip ahead to the next lesson.

**Python** is a very versatile programming language and is used in many cases: web application development (front and back), mobile games, simulations, networks, automations, Artificial Intelligence, etcetera. This versatility makes this language the most used by far the most, and it is a great advantage for any technical profile to know it.

> NOTE: It is estimated that 9 out of 10 companies use Python in some of their processes, and that these processes are essential for the proper functioning of the company.

Python is an easy to learn and use language, with inherent characteristics that make it a good alternative to other more traditional languages.

## Libraries

A **library** (*library*) is a collection of predefined functions that are made for a specific purpose. The objective is to simplify the developer's work and not to have to program them from scratch. There are many of them and they are organized according to their usefulness. As Python is the most used language in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, some of its most used libraries are related to these fields:

- Scikit-learn
- NuPIC
- Ramp
- Numpy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pipenv
- Scipy
- Matplotlib

From this top 10, most of them are used in Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision and many other areas of artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is vital that you know and know how to use some of these libraries, which are key to any data science work.

## Performance

All software that is programmed must run on hardware, which is a set of physical elements that constitute a computer system. The more efficient the code you implement, the better use of hardware resources, shorter execution times, greater possibility of parallelizing tasks, and so on.

When building artificial intelligence models, performance is a major concern, since processing power is the biggest limitation in this field at the moment. Therefore, building efficient code and functions is a mainstay. We will also learn about it.

## Code development

There are two main ways to program in Python, and each of them can be carried out using different tools:

- **Flexible programming**: this is carried out with web interfaces such as `Jupyter Notebook` or `Google Collab`. It is characterized by not having a predefined code structure and conceived to make fast and trial and error developments. In this type of development, **notebooks** are generated. 
- **Productive programming**: This is carried out in **integrated development environments** (*IDE*), which are computer programs that allow a start-to-finish development of an application or a complete service.

Normally, the development of a Machine Learning product, model or service consists of two phases: an exploratory phase and a development phase. First we program in notebooks and make proofs of concept looking for the best preprocessing, analysis and prediction of the data, and then we prepare a complete development to productivize the model.

### Project structure

We will use a template for our projects called [Cookie Cutter Datascience](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). Using a template is always a good idea to organize our project files and workflow.
