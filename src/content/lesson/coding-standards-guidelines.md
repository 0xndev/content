Limited use of globals:
These rules tell about which types of data that can be declared global and the data that canâ€™t be.

Naming conventions for local variables, global variables, constants and functions:
Some of the naming conventions are given below:
- Meaningful and understandable variables name helps anyone to understand the reason of using it.
- General variables should be named in camelCase for [Javascript, Node, Java, Ruby, etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), in `snake_case` for python
- Constant variables are named in CAPIAL LETTERS.
- It is better to avoid the use of digits in variable names.
- The names of the function should be written in camel case starting with small letters.
- The name of the function must describe the reason of using the function clearly and briefly.
