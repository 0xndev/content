## Making Your Github Profile Shine

- [ ] Set your bio, links, and avatar.
- [ ] Start committing and pushing since day 1 of the academy.
- [ ] Every project you upload must have:
    1. [ ] very detailed README.md
    2. [ ] live demo (github pages).
    3. [ ] Very organized, clean code and comments.
- [ ] You must have your "baby boy" project. The one you are proud the most. And it must be pinned on the first slot.
- [ ] You need to have contributed on at least 5 external projects.
- [ ] You need to be a [github developer program](https://developer.github.com/program/), member. You can join for free and it gives you a badge on your profile.
- [ ] Don't ever say the word "new developer" or "junior developer"
