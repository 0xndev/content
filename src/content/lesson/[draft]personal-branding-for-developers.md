## Making Your Github Profile Shine

Github is now the developers #1 portfolio, you need to make a huge effort on making it:
    
    1. Easy to browse by a potential employer.
    2. Easy to understand and fast to read.
    3. Amazing look (you never have a 2nd time to give the first impression).

### Ok, but how can I acomplish that?

There is multiple ways an you always have to make sure to give your own personal style, but in general you can focus on trying to comply with the following guidelines:

- [ ] Write a short bio with your main focus as a developer and special skills.
- [ ] Include links to your personal website, Linkedin profile, email and social media handle, if relevant.
- [ ] Add a picture or avatar.
- [ ] Start committing and pushing since day one at the academy.
- [ ] Each project you upload must include:
    1. A detailed README.md
    2. Live demo (github pages), screenshots, and gifs.
    3. Very organized, clean code and comments.
- [ ] Your most important project, the one you are proud the most, must be pinned on the first slot.
- [ ] Contribute to at least 5 external projects. Find open source projects you like and make contributions. In the following links you'll find projects and indications on how to contribute:
    - https://www.firsttimersonly.com/
    - http://yourfirstpr.github.io/
    - https://www.codetriage.com/
- [ ] You need to be a [github developer program](https://developer.github.com/program/) member. You can join for free and you will get a badge on your profile.
- [ ] Avoid using  "new developer", "junior developer", "recent graduate", or the like in your summary statement or bio.
