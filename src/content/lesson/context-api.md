## Don't be scared about "The Context API"

When you hear "The Context API" from afar it's easy to get scared, but believe when I tell you this is the easiest way the React.js team has proposed to create small to mid-sized apps.

## Why do we need The Content API?

People say that react makes the easy stuff hard and the hard stuff easy. I love that saying, it's so true :sweat: 

Think about it:

1. Why can't I just grab some value from an input?
2. Why is it so hard to share some data between the entire application?
3. Why is it so hard to pass data between components?

The Context API is here to solve some of those conundrums:

1. Avoid Property Hell: If you have worked with react already you probably have felt the frustration of passing properties all over your application, we call it "property hell". 
2. Have a centralized global application sta: Instead of having to store all the data on the view state, you can now share data on a central store that is accessible from any javascript, view or components.

For example:
<!--stackedit_data:

MzNzEwMDUxXX0=
