## Don't be scared about "The Context API"

When you hear "The Context API" from afar, you can get a little scary, that is a normal felling that you get all the time when learning new coding tricks. But believe when I teal you this is the easiest way the React.js team has proposed to create small to mid-sized apps.

## Why do we need The Content API?

Instead of viewing the Context API like a series os advantages, you should see it as a tool. If its properly used and mixed with great practices it can have dozens of PRO's, but if you miss use it, it will overcomplicate your app. That is why we are not only explaining the tool on this article, but also proposing a way of using it the same way we uset

If you have been working with react already you probably have felt the frustration of passing properties all over your application, we call it "property hell". 

Another great feature about The Context API is that you can have a centralized application store: Instead of having to store all the data on the view state, you can now share data on a central store that is accessible from any javascript, view or components.

For example:
