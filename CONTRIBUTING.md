## How do i edit the Headers 
***


You type the size of your header, hit space and write your first headline 
 
 + \# = Header 1
 + \## = Header 2
 + \### = Header 3
 + And so on 

## How do i edit the parragraphs ?
***

+ You hit Enter twice after the parragraph ends and start your new parragraph in a new line 
+ For line breaks you can type space 2 times and enter right where you want the line to break and if that doesnt work type `<b>` right where you want the line to break 

## How do i emphazise ?
***

If you want to make your text **Bold** 

+ Put 2 asterisks (\*\*) before and after the text. EXAMPLE:`**hello**`
  
If you want to make it *Italics* 

+ Put 1 asterisk (\*) before and after the text. Example `*hello*`

If you want to make it ***Italics and Bold***

+ put 3 asterisks (\*\*\*) bfore and after the text. Example `***hello***`

## How do i escape symbols that have a meaning in markdown ?
***

+ you use the backslash `\` before the symbol symbol
  
So if for example you want to use the number symbol `#` and avoid making it look as header you will type it like this `\#` and the same works for all symbols 

## How do i Blockquote my text 
***

> So if you want to blockquote your text like this 

Use the `>` symbol, press space and write your text 

## How do i make a list ?
***

+ For unordered lists like bulletpoints use `+` and `Space` to start listing your text
+ For ordered list like numerical you press for example `1.` and `Space` to start listing your text 

## How do i code block ?
***

So for example if you want this html tag `<a href=https://www.google.com/><Google></a>` not to turn in to a link and look like this  <a href=https://www.google.com/><Google></a>

You have to press 4 spaces from the begning of your line, type it and it will look like this.

    <a href=https://www.google.com/><Google></a>

## How do i make a horzontal line ?
***

for horizontal lines like the ones below the headers, you can use 3 asterisks in a row or more `***`.

It would look like this in your editor:

```
